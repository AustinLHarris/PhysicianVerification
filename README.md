Project Summary
A front-end and Node.js-based prototype for a physician credentialing platform designed to streamline onboarding for private practice doctors outside major hospital networks. Built to explore ways to reduce administrative friction and accelerate provider access to patient care.

# Physician Credentialing Prototype

This project is an early-stage prototype for a physician credentialing platform. It was designed to reduce the time and complexity required for independent physicians to get verified and onboarded into private practice networks — a known bottleneck in healthcare administration.

## 🩺 Problem Overview

Physicians working outside of hospital systems often face **lengthy and redundant credentialing processes**, especially when switching practices or affiliating with new networks. This platform aimed to:

- Digitize core credentialing steps
- Improve UX for providers submitting documentation
- Provide faster visibility for back-office administrators

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Node.js / Express** – Basic server structure
- **HTML / CSS / Vanilla JS** – UI prototyping
- **Modular CSS** – Page-specific styling
- *(Note: `node_modules` should be reinstalled via `npm install`)*

## 💡 Features (in progress)

- 📋 **Physician Verification Form**
- 🧾 Admin & rentals page mockups
- 📄 Multiple HTML templates for user flows
- 🧠 Early logic planning in `app.js`

## 📁 Key Files

- `PhysicianVerification.html` – Form and layout for credentialing
- `PhysicianVerification.css` – Modular styles for clean UI
- `index.js`, `app.js` – Express backend setup (basic routing)
- `aboutus.html`, `rentals.html`, `sleek.html` – Additional flow/page mockups
- `package.json` – Project metadata

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/physician-credentialing.git
